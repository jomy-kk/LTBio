        Good EEG periods are absent of noise and noise contamination depends on a variety of factors,

        Here 5 SQIs are evaluated:
        - Baseline wander (BW)
          Possible causes of high BW: Electrodermal noise, slow lateral eye movements, cardiobalistic artifacts, eye blinks, etc.
        - High-frequency noise (HFN):
          Possible causes of high HFN: Myogenic noise, hypoglossal and cheweing artifacts, bruxisms, electrode noise, etc.
        - Noisy Rhythmic Activity (RA):
          Possible causes of high RA: Head rubbing, chest tapping, etc.
        - Burst Drifts (BD):
          Possible causes of high BD: Eyes opening, closing and blinking; electrode pops, etc.
        - Opposing polarities slow waves (OPSW):
          Possible causes of high OPSW: Lateral eye movement (in frontal electrodes), head shaking (in back electrodes), etc.
        - Cardiac Artifacts (CA): [only applicable if 'ecg' is given]
          Possible causes of high CA: Peaks synchronised with the R wave of the ECG, etc.

        The lower, the better, for all SQIs.
